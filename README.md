## Description

- This project allows us to design and build the trebuchet which can throw the object like ping-pong ball over 5 meters using at least 2 500g PASCO weight.
- To design the trebuchet, there are several parameters might make a major contribution to the result and effectiveness of the trebuchet:
  - Mass Ratio between the Counterweight and the Projectile from law of conservation of energy.
  - Arm length ratio.
  - Friction in fulcrum.
- Some requirements:
  - The Trebuchet should not have more than 12 parts.
  - Each part should be able to fit into a 15 x 15 x 15 cm box.
  - The parts should have constant thicknesses of either 3 mm, 5 mm, or 10 mm and be made from Acrylic materials.
  - The Trebuchet shall permit aiming, which means it should be able to be adjusted for firing at different ranges and angles.

## Design & Result

- After doing calculations and simulate it in trebuchet virtual simulation, We came to the design.

- In conclusion, the trebuchet has 12 parts in total and each of them is fit into a 14 x 14 x 14 cm box. The projectile is the Ping-Pong ball and we choose 4 PASCO 500 grams weights whose total mass is 2000 grams.
- The length ratio between long and short arm is 4:1. The height of pivot is 23.5 cm as the height of each PASCO weight is 9cm and the short arm is 8cm, and we do not want them to hit the ground or the projectile runway when dropping. To leverage the arm ratio even more, we choose the sling whose length is close to that of the long arm, 30cm.
- Result: in the demonstration evaluation section, we had
  - 3 shots to test distance and all 3 shots are over 5 meters.
  - 1 shot to test accuracy and we had successfully hit the target at 4 meters.
